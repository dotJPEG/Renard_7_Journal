Explain: What is pseudocode - What is it good for?
More specifically -
Why will we use it?

Psuedocode is a good way to plan out the next thing you want to code. Its not functioning code, its just a rough draft
for what ever you want to code. We will use to to plan things out before we focus on actually making something.
