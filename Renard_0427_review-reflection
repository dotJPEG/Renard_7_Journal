The essence of human / higher level learning is developing the skill to discriminate patterns and identify shared characteristics across events (stimuli).
Memorization - the regurgitation of facts - is considered the lowest level of learning.
Why, then, are students encouraged to learn CS?
	On a basic level computer science is just memorization of basic syntax,
like what do i type to make x happen. Once you get into a non basic level of CS
though it becomes more of how can i use the assests that i know to do a certain
function, much like how learning the english language is just simple memorization
until you start writin essays and things like that.

What should students learn from CS?
	Students should learn to use everything they know to do something bigger
than just the simple building blocks of computer science. You should take all 
the knowledge you've developed with your time in CS to make an advanced program
