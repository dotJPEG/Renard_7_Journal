No, really, How will you use methods in your game? Why?
I use methods for the areas within my game. If you are in the starting room,
than you are using the starting room method, if you are in the town, than you
are using the feild method.

What values will you pass to them.
booleans to represent the possesion of items, and int's to represent progress
towards accomplishments
