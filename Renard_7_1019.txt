You should be almost done with your methods.
    Are you? Why or why not?
For the most part yes, it really depends on how much time we have left to do it.
If we still have quite a bit of time left than i will probaly add a few more
and touch up a few, otherwise though im done.

    This is a real question -- describe what you did the days we went over art methods. What did you write? type? What were your thoughts?
On those days i mostly just wrote down what was taught, and inbetween
talks/during demonstrations of stuff i knew how to do i would tinker with the
code past that, i cant quite remember.

    Did you notice that art method code was shared in the journals (as proclaimed with very large text)? Why or why not?
no, i rarely actually read the journals folder at this point, i just remember 
what is already there and just pico what i need to

    Have you examined the sample code on github? Why or why not?
Yes, it is generally a good idea to get an idea on what your about to do
especially if you've never done it before, which i haven't.

    Write a sample method for making a sequence of red squares on the canvas.

for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
drawSquare(gc,i,i,10,10);
}
private void drawSquare(GraphicsContext Square, int x, int y, int w, int h) {
	Square.setFill(Color.RED);
	Square.fillRect(x,y,w,h);
}
