Notes for data types.

                     package helloworld:
^^over arching title to connect files from the same program^^

public class HelloWorld {
#public-acces and shared with everyone. anyone can see it.
#class-an orginizational unit; recipe/template with code instructions
#HelloWorld-the file must have this name


0

	public static void main(string[]args) {
#this is in every java program. without a main class a java program wont run
this is important because this is where the execution of every java program begins.

	[you will have to memorize this line]

	Systerm.out.println("helloworld");
#this is the one command we run in our program

}

}
#notice the curly braces, for every curly brace that starts, there must be one that ends.

Char-character "a" "1" ";"
stiring-a bunch of symblos(a collection of chars) "sdf"
