    Create a class for 'Hero'
    The class should contain:
    variables for health, score, power/weapon, dexterity, perception, level, x, y, z, and a symbol
    There should also be a class constructor accepting inputs for name, x, y, and symbol
    Provide an example of initializing a hero object with your name
    Explain why you would not initialize the hero in class hero.


public class Hero(){
	int health;
	int score;
	int power;
	int dex;
	int per;
	int lvl;
	int x, y, z;
	String look = "@";
}
public datatype getstat(just pretend i have getters and setter for everything stated becuase im not writing one for every vaiable){
	return stat;
}
public void setstat(datatype i){
	stat = i;
}



(in main)
public static void main(String[]args){
	Hero hero;
    if(hero.getstat() == "dat boi"){
	hero.setstat(dankmeme);
    }
}



you cant create an instance of something if you are already in it
furthurmore, you initialize a class as to have different versions of the same thing, so there is no point to initializing a class within itself
