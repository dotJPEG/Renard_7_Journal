During / after the holiday, we will be constructing "dungeon crawlers" (or side-scrollers).


Describe the 2-D dungeon or world you would like to have for your game.
I will probaly make a very tile based game, like the binding of issac, or 
the legend of zelda

Why?
Its a great place to start, not that hard to do, and if i do it right i can
give the game flow reguardless of ahving to change screens to progress
