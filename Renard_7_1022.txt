What is the purpose of creating art with code to learn?
The purpose of creating art with your code is that it allows you to actually
visualize what you are creating with your lines of code. In other cases, such
as plain java, you dont really get to see the code in action, just the outputs
that you instructed it to do such as "system.out.println("blah");
