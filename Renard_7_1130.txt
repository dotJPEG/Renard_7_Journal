How successful were you with your game?
The game came along almost exactly as planned, though the additions of combat 
were slightly forced as I didn't notice it was manditory until the Friday that 
is was due. Other than that though I am quite comfortable with how it came along

In what way? Be specific.
As per usual I answered this in the previous question, just read everything 
after the first comma
