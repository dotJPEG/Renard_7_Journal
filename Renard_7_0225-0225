What does the code below do?
creates a 2d array and then prints out a grid based on what is held within the 
array

How could you make it print an X? i.e., what array values would you change?
change the code so that x's are located in positions on the map where they would need to be to make the shape on an X out of x's.

How could you use this to make a 5 in a row game?
Change the values of positions in the map so that values that would be a part of the body of the 5 are equal to x

 import java.util.Arrays;

public class SampleArray {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        char[][] map = new char[9][9];
        map[0][0] = 'x';
        map[2][3] = 'x';
        map[4][4] = 'x';
        map[7][7] = 'x';
        map[8][8] = 'x';
        for (int i = 0; i <= map[0].length - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= map[1].length - 1; j++) {
                if (j < map[1].length - 1) {
                    if (map[i][j] != 'x') {
                        System.out.print(".");
                    } else {
                        System.out.print(map[i][j]);
                    }
                } else {
                    if (map[i][j] != 'x') {
                        System.out.println(".");
                    } else {
                        System.out.println(map[i][j]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
