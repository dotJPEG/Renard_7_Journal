Describe what you will have to do to clean up your code to make the program 
more your own (and legible). 
Im going to fix the "pathing" on my enemies to make that work, then the game 
will work fine. To make the game my own, i would have to make the importannt
classes in my own way, instead of using the resources provided. I havent
the least bit of a clue on how to do so though, and likely wont learn any time
soon.
