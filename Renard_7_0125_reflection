Briefly describe what you could have done to successfully complete your game?
Stayed after on Friday to fix the issue of the enemies in my game clipping 
through certain walls

Describe your problem solving / trouble shooting process.
I would first check for errors, then i would check the things that relate to the
problems. Than i would keep changing things until the game felt bad and worked.
