Is your guessing game a game? Why or why not?
Kind of, it's just guess a number and hope the game doesnt call you trash

What would make it better?
add something that strays from the simple idea of guessing a random number
that is somewhere in a range of numbers, maybe aswer a few questions using
strigs or something like that
