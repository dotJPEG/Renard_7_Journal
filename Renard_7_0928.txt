For the journal today, describe the following:
How can you count in Java?
By using a for loop [for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++){
you also start at 0 when counting
How can you check to see if a number is divisible?
by using the modulo command (%)
How can you track if a number has a divisor? 
also by using the modulo command, but you have to check for a remainder when checking a feild of numbers [i % o != 0]
