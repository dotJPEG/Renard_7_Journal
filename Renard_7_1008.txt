What are your tentative thoughts / plans for your art project?
Im probaly going to make something like a sword in a stone hilt in the ground, like in Ocarina of Time, it will be easy, just a few rectangles, trapeziods, and triangles

What might be methods you will use?
Each shape that I use will ahve a method for it, and the user input will be to unsheath the sword, which will have its own methods

How might you incorporate a for loop?
I will have a loop to check for user input

How might you incorporate, if, else if, else?
an if to check for input, and an else to tell what to do if no input detected

What math might you use? 
Simple things like for loops to check for user input on a tick-by-tick basis
