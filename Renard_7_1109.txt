Are you ready to begin coding your game?
For the most part yes

Why or why not?
Im not quite done with the flowchart, but I don't really need to finish it in 
all honesty

What will be your biggest challenges?

By far my biggest challenge will be managing all the branching paths and 
command options

Why?
Its kind of self explanetory, by the end of the project, it'll probaly look 
like a jumbled mess
