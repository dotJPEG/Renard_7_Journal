0 Have to make the orb move a certain direction based on where im facing
1 had to make the orb move
2 had to make the orb appear without errors
3 had to make the orb be up for after you press the space bar
4 had to fix my movement before i was able to test my changes to the orb
5 had to go into the build file and actually identify where things were going wrong
6 game didnt have a working orb for a while because ive been caught up in
getting the movement into the player class
7 had to fix a few problems that persisted in the code from before data-con
8 ohter than that i havent had any problems for the most part
9 so im just putting some text down to make it look good
