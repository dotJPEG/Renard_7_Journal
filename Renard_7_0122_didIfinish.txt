Briefly describe what you did or did not do that allowed or prevented the timely completion of your game. [Consider the posted timeline, whether you 
met that timeline, and if you were not meeting that timeline when and whether you worked on the project outside of class.

Well you see what happend was, i succeded in the first goal, and then got run over by a brick wall of confusion. But like most things in life,
I proceded to smack my head into the brick wall until it finally gave way to a success one week after the goals were due, still on time though.
So in other words I had a few problems but i either fixed them or worked around them,ezpz
