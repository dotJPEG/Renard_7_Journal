There will be an end of year assessment.
What are 10 concepts ou think will be covered. Why?

1. OOP, we have been primarily foccusing on the use of objects recently
2. general use of classes, classes are something that you just need to know to be at all effeciant with
Java, and as it happens, a lot of the students (in my class atleast) dont exactly have a grasp on the use of java classes
3. Class constructers, can kinda be put with general class use, but it really deserves its own spot,
if you dont know about class constructers than you cant really use classes to their full potential
4. Methods, methods are a fairly large part of java regardless of how simple they are, so
yes it will be an easy part of the test, but it will be an important part no-less
5. creation/using of variables, variables are the backbone of programming, there really isnt a lot you can do withuot them.
We will probably be tested on the basics of it like creation and setting and that sort of thing, but i imagine we will also have a few questions
on what each is, how to cast them, that sort of thing.
6. The different libraries in java that makes coding easy, like how typing System.out,println(""); prints text on a new line in the terminal
instead of having to type a massive amount of specifics like you would have to do in something like assembly where there arent really any libraries in place for you
7. for loops, while loops, etc. One good question would be what is the difference between a for loop and a while loop, and why you
would use one over the other.
