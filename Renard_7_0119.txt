What slick game did you create?
It's a simple game of rock paper scissors when it comes down to it. It wasnt hard to make, but on that note
it wouldnt have been hard to creat a game where you run from one point to another trying not to get hit by bad
guys which would of most certainly gotten a better grade. I mainly chose to go with the lame game of rock paper scissors
because no one else was, and on the rubric it said to be unique, so yeah.

What challenges did you solve?
Well i faced the challenge of time, which i wasnt really able to solve. I tried
to work on my game at home this weekend, but my dad decided it was a good time
to upgrade to windows 10 on my pc, so most of my weekend went to fixing it. I 
was able to do a little bit on monday, but i still have to make the start screen
and the win/loss screen.
