    The Slick assignment was intended to gently familiarize you with 2-D arrays. Some students recognized the 2-D arrays from Slick and previous journals --- other students had 
no recollection. Which were you? Why? Note - attributing the environment is not pragmatic - as students experienced the same environment (though they might have experienced 
it differently) Make a list of ten questions related to the Array assignments pt 1 and 2 - that you predict will be on the semester exam. E.g., object initialization, class 
constructors, creating and changing arrays, etc.

	I was neither, Jeff taught me how to use 2d Arrays quite awhile ago, so i didnt really have to deal with the struggle of learning how to use a 2d array.
how initialize 2d array?
how fill 2d array?
you want poot dots in all spots in 2d array, what do?
what is a valid example of a use for a 2d array?
how get limey in 2d array?
how would you make a set method for a 2d array?
a get method?
how would you print out a 2d array
im just gonna stop here, id rather spend time working on my code than sitting here trying to think of more reasonable questions
