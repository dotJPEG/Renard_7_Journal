One of the main things that i've learned in CS during my time with arduino is
obvously how to program in C, to an extent atleast. I still have a lot to learn 
with C as i still dont even really understand how to structure most commands, 
or understand most commands to begin with. I am picking it up bit by bit as i go 
though so id call it a work in progress.

Another thing ive learned while working with arduinos is how a lot of simple
machines in our day to day life work. Things like the birthday cards that
play a song when you open them, i now understand the maching behind the speaker.
It's really nice to actually have some sort of an understanding in the workings
of our every day world, it gives me the feeling i get in IT when i learn about
the structure and functions of a network.

Lastly, ive learned about circuits, granted what i've gotten out of this is a 
very basic undersatnding that has much to improve, but regardless it is helpful.
Over the course of learning arduinos ive learned simple things like the structure
of a basic circuit and gotten an understanding about what a circuit needs to function.
Additionally, i've learned about a few gates by just haering about them second hand, gates like AND, NOR, XOR, etc..
