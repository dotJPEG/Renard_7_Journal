We will be revising our games so that they are more 'finished'. This will require revision and retweaking.


Why bother with revising and resubmitting?
It will make the game more yours, and in some cases more functional. Before we started
revising our games were not all that special. They were mainly just a copy of someone else's
that we put our own variables into.
