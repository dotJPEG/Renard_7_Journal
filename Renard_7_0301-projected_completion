Your revised Slick project is due Friday [Monday if you do homework]

Do you have another level?
No, but i will here in a few days

Will your revisions be complete? Why? Why not?
They'll be complete, its not that what im (or the rest of the class) is adding 
is particularly difficult to add, its that there is a lot to add, im making my
way through the rubric quite fast though
