My Project is a sword, so far ive been leaning towards master sword style of
looks, which is planted into a pedistal in the ground similar to the Excaliber.
There is a gold circle around the pedistal for detail and Gold lines going
across the screen for detail. Obviously this is not the final product, its 
just a bland version of it. Once im done it will look much more refined
and most importantly less flat. Until then im working on making out the final
sketch of the project so that i can have something to work off of for when i
get to the challengin parts. Im planning to use sine and cosine, but im not 
quite sure how im going to use them.
