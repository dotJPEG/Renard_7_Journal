Today you submit the final draft of your game and an essay analyzing it.

Were you successful? Why or why not?
In my opinion, I was successful. I did everything I had to do for the rubric,
and I learned a lot from it. I know many more options for tasks I previously
thought challangeing to make them easy, so yes, I was successful.
