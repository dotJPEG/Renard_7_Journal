Explain what we did yesterday (with github) and why.
More specifically -
Describe the git steps you will do everytime.

Yesterday we were taught how to create text documents in our git repositories, and how to upload them to git. 
Everytime we want to make a new entre we will need to do the command "pico Renard_7_<date>". When we are done with the journal we type "git push". This will keep the repository up to date.


Command list:
git add myfilename
git commit -m "message"
git push -u origin master
