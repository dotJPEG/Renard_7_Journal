    Explain casting. Up-casting, Down-casting.
Casting is a method of organization in java, similar to the way that different animal kingdoms are organized in biolagy, 
up casting is to get more broad, and down casting is to get more specific, like cat or dog as opposed to something like animal or mammal

    Give a specific code example for up-casting
int cat;
double dog;
dog = cat;

    Give a specific code example for down-casting
int cat;
double dog;
cat = (int)dog;

    Give a specific code example for converting a char to a String
char bleh = 'a';
String asdf = "" + a;
//you can also use this to change an int or double to a string which is pretty cool i guess

    What is the range of values for byte? Why?
-128 to 127
this i because of the way that each of the two caps would be represented
in binary, 127 in binary is 01111111, 128 cant be represented, therefor
10000000 is -128 and cant be 128
