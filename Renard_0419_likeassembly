assembly and human resource machine are similar because they both have very
similar syntax i.e. jump, conditional jump, copyto(making variables within assmebly), etc.

they are different because when using human ersource machine it is more like using
something such as java that already has libraries because youjust input a command
and go, in assembly you have to manually set every single specific yourself.
